**Vulnerability Title:**  TOTOTOLINK - X5000R V9.1.0u.6118-B20201102 Model and A7000R V9.1.0u.6115-B20201022 There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the IP field, which can cause denial of service attacks and even arbitrary code execution

**Affected version:**  X5000R V9.1.0u.6118-B2020 1102 A7000 R V9.1.0u.6115-B2020 1022

Discovered on December 20, 2023

**Discovered by** : He Nan (2777256035@qq.com)

**Analysis report:**

When the sub_41F7E8 function in the/www/cgi bin/cstegi.cgi file (using X5000R device as an example) was triggered to copy the content of the IP field by the sprintf function, the data length was not checked, resulting in a buffer overflow

**Attack demonstration:**

Send a normal data packet to the vulnerability interface of the router, with an IP field of four A's, and see that the returned packet is in a normal 200 state

If the data in the IP field is sent as a large amount of junk data, it is found that the returned data packet is a 500 status code

Telnet debugged inside the router and found that the $ra register had been hijacked to 0x61616161, which means we can redirect the execution flow to any known address in the process and execute code from anywhere
